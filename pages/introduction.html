    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! Here I will display some coding projects and components.</p>

    <h1>How it started</h1>
    <p>
        My interest in software development came from my desire to make games and game-mods. 
        Therefore, after I finished highschool (middelbare school), I applied to the MBO education: Game-development. 
        Here I got to familiarize with C++ for game development and C# for application development. 
        I strongly prefered application development so I switched education from game- to application development. 
        I graduated 2 years later and started working for my first company as a back-end .NET web-developer, mainly working with ASP.NET MVC web-applications and SQL databases.
