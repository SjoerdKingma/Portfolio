<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
    Recycle bin cleaner is a small tool which cleans Windows recycle bin based on user input. 
</p>
<p>
    After entering a list of filenames in UserSettings.json, the user can run the executable to remove all files from Windows recycle bin whose names are equal to the names entered in the UserSettings.json.
    After finishing, the application immediately closes. The user can then open Logs.json to view the results.
</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>
    Recycle bin cleaner is a tool made with .NET, using the C# programming language.
    It only runs on Windows machines.
</p>
<p>
    I use the shell32 library which is present in Windows by default in: C:/Windows/System32.
    This package contains functionality for the developer to interact with special windows folders such as the recycle bin.
</p>

Here I show how I use shell32.dll in my code:

And this is how the file or folder gets deleted:
