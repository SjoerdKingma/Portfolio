<h3>Intro</h3>
<p> 
    This portfolio website contains some of the projects I worked on, as well as components and coding challenges.
    Components are pieces of code which I'm either proud to show, or redeemed useful in the future.
    On each individual project, component and coding challenge can be clicked to view additional information.

<p>
    I made this website in my spare time as a hobby.

<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>
    My portfolio website is made with Html, Css, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery. 
    It's front-end only. Any information about projects, components and challenges is stored in json files on the web server and retrieved with Javascript.

<h4>Loading pages</h4>
Instead of loading a new html page each time, this website stores page-specific info in seperate html components and loads these in the index.html.
On clicking a link, JS code in index.html will retrieve the corresponding URL for the html component, and load it into index.html. It then refreshes the page to display the new component.
This modulair approach helps to avoid having to edit all pages their html files upon making changes to the shared elements.
