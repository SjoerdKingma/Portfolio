<h2>Care-for-some-tea-saboteur</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
    For our college graduation project, me and 2 other classmates wanted to make a card game inspired by one of our favorite games: Hearthstone.
    We chose a steampunk theme for art style and named it "Care-for-some-tea-saboteur".
</p>

<p>Some criteria for this game were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 Players must be able to find a match through a matchmaking system and play against eachother over the internet.</li>
    <li>Log-in system with user accounts to store information about each player.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>
    The solution consists of 3 seperate applications working together: The game client, the game server and the web application (including an API.)
    Both the game server and the web server ran on my classmates' physical server at home.
    The game client can be downloaded from the website, which has been taken offline after we graduated college.
</p>
<p>
    One of my 2 classmates was studying game-development so his task was to make the game. 
    We decided the game will be made with Unity game engine.
</p>
<P>
    Me and my other classmate were studying application development. 
    I volunteered to make the game-server because I knew I would learn a lot on networking and I didnt't know much about it yet.
</P>
<P>
    My other classmate had never made an API yet, so he was happy to make the website with API.
</P>

<h3>Game-server</h3>
<p>
    On this page I will focus only on the game server, as I haven't contributed anything to the game client and web-app.
    The game server is a console application written in C# which i've made entirely by myself.
</p>
Its job is to:
<ul>
    <li>Communicate between the game client and API.</li>
    <li>Handle matchmaking for all players in the matchmaking queue.</li>
    <li>Connect 2 players and have their game clients launch a game against eachother.</li>
    <li>Update game changes between 2 players. Meaning: If one player makes a move, the other player can also see it.</li>
    <li>Communicate chat messages between 2 game clients.</li>
</ul>
