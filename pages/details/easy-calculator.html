<h2>Easy Calculator</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
    Easy calculator is a tool written in C# which aims for a more efficient way to perform calculations, compared to a traditional calculator.
    Its goal is to provide a way for the user to make calculations with as little actions as possible.
    This is useful for people who have to make a lot of calculations manually.
</p>

The main features which sets this tool apart from a traditional calculator are:
<ul>
    <li>
        You can perform a lot of manual operations by simply entering a number and pressing the Enter on your keyboard.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ability for the user to remember the number input, simplifying the task even further; Now you can repeatedly press the Enter key to perform the same calculation multiple times.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>User Interface</h3>
<p>This is what the user interface looks like:</p>

<p>
    As you can see, the operator choice (plus, minus, multiply, divide by) is always remembered. Its advantage being the user not having to enter the operator symbol themselves.
    And the user has the ability to remember his input so that he only requires to press the Enter button to repeat the previous calculation.
</p>

<p>The <b>clear</b> button clears the user input and the output of the tool, so that the user may start from scratch again.</p>
<p>The <b>undo button</b> removes the last operation performed on the formula.</p>
<p>The <b>formula window</b> displays the complete formula of the calculation made by the user.</p>
<p>On the very buttom is the <b>output window</b> for the answer. In case the application runs into a problem, it will display an error here instead of an answer.</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>
    Easy calculator is a .NET Winforms project. Winforms is a framework designed to provide an easy way for developers to build user interfaces for Windows applications.
    In a similar way to Javascript, Winforms likes to add event handlers to components such as Buttons and Text fields.
