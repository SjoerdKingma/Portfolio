<h3>Intro</h3>
<p> 
    This portfolio website contains some of the projects I worked on, as well as components and coding challenges.
    Components are pieces of code which I'm either proud to show, or redeemed useful in the future.
    On each individual project, component and coding challenge can be clicked to view additional information.    
</p>
<p>
    I made this website in my spare time as a hobby.

<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p>
    My portfolio website is made from scratch with Html, Css, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery. 
    It's front-end only. Any information about projects, components and challenges is stored in json files on the web server and retrieved with Javascript.
</p>

<h4>Loading pages</h4>
<p>
    Instead of loading a new html page each time a link is clicked, the webserver stores page-specific content in seperate html components and loads these into a placeholder div in index.html.
    On clicking a navigation link, the JS code in index.html will retrieve the corresponding html component, and load that into the page. It then refreshes the page to display this new component.
</p>
<p>
    This modulair approach helps to avoid having to edit all pages their html files upon making changes to the shared elements.
    A downside of this approach is it becomes impossible to debug code, as the javascript code is executed before the DOM element is loaded. The console.log method still works, but step-by-step debugging isn't possible.

<h4>Displaying list items</h4>
<p>To display list items, I use an HTML template for every list item and adjust the values of the template depending on the given data.</p>
<p>This screenshot shows how the values are set: </p>
